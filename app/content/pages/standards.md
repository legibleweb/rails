# Standards

Legible Web consists of a few standards.

## Markdown

Ok, ya got me! Markdown isn't really "standard" per se, so you could say this whole thing is built on mud.

Somebody did by [standardmarkdown.com](https://standardmarkdown.com), which looks pretty legit, so for now let's call that the standard.

If you open [this Github file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/allysonsilva/85fff14a22bbdf55485be947566cc09e/raw/fa8048a906ebed3c445d08b20c9173afd1b4a1e5/Full-Markdown.md), it should open in this browser.

## Navigation

Navigation is a JSON file that's downloaded on each request.
